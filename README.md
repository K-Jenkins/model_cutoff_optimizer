Excel workbook (non-macro .xlsx) designed to optimize statistical model identification thresholds based on business constraints (revenue, cost, intervention). The workbook provides the optimal cutoff, revenue, variance, specificity, sensitivity and other metrics. The optimizer works for any number of records, and includes an in-sheet ensemble calculator for testing different model combinations. The workbook includes multiple logistic regression and random forest outputs for example (models created for [UCI Credit Card Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)). Full report of data set analysis, modeling and recommendation available by request.
